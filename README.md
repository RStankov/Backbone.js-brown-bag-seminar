# Backbone.js brown bag seminar

Backbone.js demo. I created for a brown bag seminar

It is simple version of LOOKK.com upload sketch with pins form.  
Which I found to be better example, than the "standard" TODO app.

## Install

```
$ bundle install
$ ruby app.rb
```

## Usage

Just navigate to http://localhost:3000 and play around
